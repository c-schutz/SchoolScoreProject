In this project we will take in data on school scores
and answer hypotheses based on these questions.

Hypotheses:

1. Is there a correlation between income and SAT scoring?
2. Is there a correlation between a higher GPA and a higher SAT score?
3. Is there a difference in scoring between genders on certain SAT subjects?
4. Is there a correlation between study habits and SAT score
