In this project we will take in data on school scores
and answer hypotheses based on these questions.

Hypotheses:

1. Is there a correlation between total math SAT scores in FLorida and California?
2. Is there a correlation between SAT scores and income?
3. Is there a difference in scoring between genders on certain SAT subjects?
4. Is there a correlation between taking arts based classes and SAT score
